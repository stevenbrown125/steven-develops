          I&#39;m a Full Stack Javascript developer from the US. Web Design &
          Development is my passion and I love working with Javascript. After
          finishing off 9 years as a Russian Cryptologic Linguist for the US
          Army, I have been on a mission to become an expert in all areas of
          software engineering. On the frontend, I have experience working
          with Angular and React. On the backend, I prefer NestJS and Express,
          but have been recently working more with Go. I have my AWS Solutions
          Architect and CompTia SEC+ Certifications and work almost daily in
          the cloud. I love building effective CI/CD pipelines using Github
          Actions and Jenkins and am constantly looking for ways to improve
          processes. Speaking of processes, I currently work as a Systems
          Engineer and SIGINT/EW SME, subcontracting for General Dynamics
          Mission Systems. For the remainder of this year, I am focused on
          continuing to learn MBSE, C++, Golang, and building more products on
          AWS.

          In the military, I worked in Signals Intelligence. I recently earned
          my HAM Amateur Radio License and enjoy working on projects that
          connect the EMS world to cloud computing. Oh, I also love to travel
          and make videos so check out my blog to see some of my latest
          adventures!
