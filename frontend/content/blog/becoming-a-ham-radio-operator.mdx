Looking back at the past month, I've learned far more about HAM radio than I expected. What seemed like a simple hobby revealed itself to be a deeply technical and nuanced field. From understanding how radios function to learning the legal and ethical frameworks that govern them, this journey has been eye-opening. Here are some of the key lessons that stood out.

## Electrical Principles: The Backbone of HAM Radio

Understanding core electrical concepts was essential. **Voltage, current, and resistance** are not abstract ideas—they are the foundation of every radio system.

- **Voltage** provides the force that moves electrons.
- **Current** is the actual flow of electrons.
- **Resistance** slows that flow down.

Having a solid grasp of these fundamentals makes it easier to build and troubleshoot radio equipment and antennas.

## Ohm's Law: More Than Just a Formula

Ohm’s Law finally clicked for me after studying it multiple times. It connects voltage, current, and resistance:

> **V = I × R**

If you're designing a DIY antenna, Ohm’s Law helps determine resistance and component selection. It's also incredibly useful in diagnosing issues when something in your setup isn’t behaving as expected.

## Capacitance and Inductance: Tuning Your System

Two concepts that became crucial as I dove deeper were **capacitance** and **inductance**.

- **Capacitors** store energy in an electric field.
- **Inductors** store energy in a magnetic field.

These components are vital when tuning circuits and designing systems for specific frequencies. For example, operating on HF bands often requires careful tuning for long-distance communication. Understanding how capacitors and inductors work together allows for more effective and efficient antenna systems.

## Looking Ahead

My goal is to continue studying and earn my General License before the end of 2023. Fingers crossed that I can make the time!
