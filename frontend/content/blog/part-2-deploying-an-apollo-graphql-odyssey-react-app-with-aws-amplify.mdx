Welcome to **Part 2** of deploying our **Apollo GraphQL Castronaut App** with **Amazon Web Services**. In **Part 1**, we deployed our Apollo GraphQL server using **AWS Lambda**. In this article, we’ll deploy the **React client** using **AWS Amplify**, completing the full-stack deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, make sure you’ve completed the following:

- Complete **Apollo GraphQL – Lift Off Part 5 (Deploying Apollo Server)**
- Complete [**Part 1: Deploying the Apollo GraphQL Server with AWS Lambda**](/blog/post/part-1-deploying-an-apollo-graphql-odyssey-server-with-aws-lambda)
- Create an **AWS account**
- Install the **AWS CLI**
- Configure AWS CLI credentials
- Commit your updated Apollo Client URI changes to GitHub

## Configuring AWS Amplify

To get started, log into the **AWS Console** and navigate to **AWS Amplify**.

1. Click **Get Started** under _Amplify Hosting_
2. Choose **GitHub** as your repository provider
3. Authorize GitHub access (limit permissions to the required repository)
4. Select your client repository (`odyssey-lift-off-part5-client`)
5. Choose the `main` branch and continue

AWS Amplify will automatically detect your React application and prepare it for deployment.

⚠️ **Important**: Ensure your GraphQL backend from Part 1 is still running. If you previously removed it, redeploy it before proceeding:

```bash
serverless deploy
```

## Deploying the React Application

Once your repository is connected, AWS Amplify will:

- Provision hosting infrastructure
- Install dependencies
- Build the React application
- Deploy it to a public URL

This process may take a few minutes. Amplify enables **continuous deployment** by default, meaning every push to the selected branch triggers a new build.

When deployment completes, Amplify provides a public URL to your live application.

## Verifying the Deployment

Visit the Amplify-hosted URL and verify:

- The application loads successfully
- Apollo Client connects to the deployed GraphQL endpoint
- Queries and mutations function as expected

If everything works, your **full-stack Apollo GraphQL application is now live**.

## Cleaning Up AWS Resources

Once you’re finished experimenting or demonstrating the application, it’s important to clean up resources to avoid unexpected costs.

### Remove the React app

From the **AWS Amplify Console**:

- Select **Actions → Delete app**
- Confirm deletion

### Remove the GraphQL backend

From your server project root:

```bash
npx serverless remove
```

This removes the Lambda function, CloudFormation stack, and S3 artifacts.

## Conclusion

You’ve now completed the **Apollo Odyssey** by deploying both:

- A **GraphQL server** using AWS Lambda
- A **React client** using AWS Amplify

This setup replaces Heroku with a scalable, production-ready AWS solution while preserving a clean developer workflow with continuous deployment and managed infrastructure.
