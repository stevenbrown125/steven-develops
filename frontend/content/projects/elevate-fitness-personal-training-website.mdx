**Challenge:**
Elevate Fitness needed a modern, high-performance website built from scratch to establish an online presence. The site needed to clearly communicate services, support future content growth, collect leads reliably, and meet modern performance, accessibility, and SEO standards.

**Solution:**
I handled the full lifecycle—design, development, and deployment—using Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript for long-term maintainability. Sanity was integrated as a headless CMS to allow non-technical content updates. TailwindCSS provided a clean, responsive UI, while Formik and Yup powered robust form validation. AWS SES was used for reliable transactional email delivery.

**Outcomes:**

- **Modern Architecture:** Built on Next.js 15 with the App Router and React 19, ensuring scalability and long-term support.
- **Performance & SEO:** Optimized rendering, metadata, and asset handling for fast load times and strong search engine visibility.
- **Content Flexibility:** Sanity Studio enabled easy updates to classes, programs, and marketing content without developer involvement.
- **Lead Generation:** Implemented validated contact and inquiry forms with secure email delivery via AWS SES.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully mobile-first and cross-browser compatible, including support down to Safari 14.
- **Maintainability:** Strong typing with TypeScript and a clean dependency setup reduced technical debt from launch.

This project established Elevate Fitness’s digital foundation with a production-ready, scalable platform that supports both marketing and operational growth from day one.
