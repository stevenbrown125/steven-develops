**Challenge:**
HAM radio operators interested in satellite communication often rely on fragmented tools and text-based data to understand satellite orbits, visibility windows, and pass timing. These tools can be unintuitive, especially for visual learners or newer operators trying to grasp complex orbital concepts.

**Solution:**
HAM Companion was developed as a Full Sail school project to explore how 3D geospatial visualization could improve the HAM satellite communication experience. Using Cesium and Resium, the application renders satellites orbiting Earth in real time, providing operators with a clear, spatial understanding of satellite position, trajectory, and visibility.

The frontend was built with React and Vite for fast iteration and performance, while a Node.js and Express backend provided APIs for satellite data, user authentication, and persistence. TLE (Two-Line Element) data was processed server-side to calculate satellite orbits and pass predictions.

**Outcomes:**

- **3D Satellite Visualization:** Real-time rendering of satellite orbits and Earth positioning using Cesium.
- **Improved Operator Insight:** Visual context helped demystify satellite passes and orbital mechanics for HAM operators.
- **Full-Stack Architecture:** Clean separation between a modern frontend and an API-driven backend.
- **Educational Value:** Served as a practical application of geospatial math, real-time data processing, and visualization techniques.
- **Capstone Execution:** Demonstrated the ability to design, build, and integrate a complex technical system end to end.

HAM Companion showcases applied problem-solving, full-stack development, and the use of advanced visualization tools to make complex technical domains more approachable.
