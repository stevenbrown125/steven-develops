**Challenge:** The original PID Analyzers website was built using traditional HTML and PHP/MySQL, lacking mobile optimization and modern web standards.

**Solution:** I spearheaded the redesign of the PID Analyzers website, leveraging NextJS for static site generation, Sanity.io for headless CMS functionality, and TailwindCSS for responsive design. This transformation enabled seamless browsing of the company’s product catalog and simplified quote requests through an intuitive Call to Action (CTA) button.

**Outcomes:**

- **Mobile Optimization:** Achieved full mobile responsiveness, enhancing user experience across all devices.
- **SEO and Best Practices:** Significantly improved with a Lighthouse audit score increase of over 40 points, ensuring better visibility and accessibility.
- **Performance:** Enhanced site performance by 15 points, as per Lighthouse reporting, resulting in faster load times and a smoother user interface.
- **Content Management:** Integrated Sanity Studio, enabling easy content updates and management without technical assistance.

This comprehensive redesign not only modernized the PID Analyzers' online presence but also improved operational efficiency and customer engagement.
