**Challenge:**
As a new game development graduate, Sam needed a portfolio that could compete visually and technically with experienced candidates. Standard template-based portfolios failed to convey depth, craftsmanship, or personality—critical factors for standing out to recruiters, art directors, and studio leads.

**Solution:**
I designed and developed a bespoke portfolio using Next.js and React 19, focusing on motion, layout, and storytelling. Subtle parallax effects, scroll-based animation, and clean typography were used to guide attention without distracting from the work itself. TailwindCSS ensured consistency and speed of iteration, while motion-based interactions elevated perceived quality and professionalism.

The site architecture emphasizes clarity: quick access to portfolio pieces, strong personal branding, and direct calls to action for recruiters.

**Outcomes:**

- **Differentiation:** A custom-designed experience that avoids generic portfolio patterns and immediately signals quality and intention.
- **Visual Storytelling:** Motion-driven sections and parallax effects enhance engagement while keeping focus on Sam’s work.
- **Recruiter-Focused UX:** Clear navigation, fast load times, and prominent contact actions reduce friction for hiring managers.
- **Performance:** Built on Next.js with modern bundling and image optimization for smooth performance across devices.
- **Scalable Structure:** Modular components make it easy to add new projects as Sam’s career progresses.

This portfolio positions Sam as a serious, detail-oriented candidate—bridging the gap between academic experience and professional studio expectations through thoughtful design and execution.
